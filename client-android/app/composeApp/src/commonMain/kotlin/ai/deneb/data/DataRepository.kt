/**
 * The chat surface the UI talks to. The sole production implementation is
 * [ai.deneb.deneb.DenebGatewayClient], which drives the Deneb gateway's
 * `miniapp.*` RPC surface; [ai.deneb.testutil.FakeDataRepository] backs the
 * ViewModel tests.
 *
 * Scope: only what `ChatViewModel`, `TaskScheduler`, and `MainActivity` reach
 * through this interface type. Everything else the gateway client exposes —
 * mail, calendar, wiki, models, fleet, work-feed, capture — lives as concrete
 * members / extension functions on `DenebGatewayClient` and the screens take it
 * by concrete type. The legacy on-device (cloud-direct) provider surface that
 * used to live here (configured services, per-instance keys, MCP, soul, on-device
 * memory/scheduling/email/SMS settings, `askWithTools`/`askSilently`) was removed
 * along with `RemoteDataRepository`.
