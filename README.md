**Deneb** is a self-hosted AI agent framework focused on one thing: **never losing context**. Starting from OpenClaw, Deneb intentionally shed mobile clients, unused channels, and enterprise plugins to create a lean 230K-line server engine — then built a custom Lossless Context Management (LCM) system with DAG-based compaction, proactive background summarization, and full memory recall across sessions.

Deneb is actively diverging from OpenClaw. We're not maintaining a fork — we're building a different program with a different focus: **memory-first, local-first, lean-first.**

## ⭐ Why Deneb

Most AI agent frameworks hit the same wall: when conversations grow long, context gets compressed and important details vanish. Deneb solves this with **lossless memory** — every decision, number, name, and technical detail is preserved through intelligent compaction and multi-layer recall.

### What's Different

|                        | Typical Agent Framework  | Deneb                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Long conversations** | Summarize → lose details | DAG-based compaction preserves everything      |
| **Context recall**     | Vector search only       | Semantic search + DAG expansion + memory files |
| **Compaction latency** | Blocks on LLM call       | Background observer pre-computes summaries     |
| **Memory persistence** | Session-scoped           | Workspace files + JSONL transcripts + LCM DAG  |
| **Codebase size**      | 500K–1M+ lines           | 230K lines — lean and auditable                |
| **Local LLM**          | Optional                 | First-class: SGLang, Ollama, vLLM support      |

### Intentional Simplification

Every feature that doesn't serve the core mission was removed — not because we couldn't build it, but because leaner code means fewer bugs, faster iterations, and code you can actually read and modify.

What's gone: mobile apps, desktop companions, 12+ niche channels, enterprise multi-tenant plugins. What remains: a focused agent engine that remembers everything and runs on a single GPU.

## ⭐ Key Features

### 🧠 Lossless Context Management (LCM)

The core differentiator. A DAG-structured summary system that compresses conversations without losing details.

- **DAG-based compaction** — Summaries reference each other in a directed acyclic graph, enabling deep recall of any past detail
- **Custom identifier preservation** — Project names, amounts, dates, and technical terms survive compression intact
- **Background observer** — Proactively pre-computes summaries using local LLM, so compaction is instant when triggered
- **Multi-layer recall** — `lcm_grep` → `lcm_describe` → `lcm_expand` → `lcm_expand_query` for progressively deeper memory retrieval
- **Quality guard** — Automatic retry with conservative settings if summary quality drops

### 🤖 Autonomous Loop Engine

24/7 self-directed operation for proactive monitoring and task execution.

- **Attention system** — Priority queue for signals from channels, goals, and deadlines
- **Goal tracking** — Define, track progress, and manage deadlines
- **State persistence** — Survives restarts with corruption recovery
- **Configurable cycles** — Adjustable interval (default 5min) with rate limiting

### 🔄 Multi-Agent Orchestration

Spawn and manage sub-agents with bounded contexts for complex tasks.

- **Sub-agent sessions** — Each with independent context and lifecycle
- **Bounded execution** — Token limits, timeouts, and tool policy per agent
- **Result streaming** — Real-time progress from sub-agents to parent

### 📡 Messaging Channels

Battle-tested in production with the channels that matter most.

| Channel         | Notes                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Telegram**    | ✅ Primary — full feature support, reactions, polls, inline buttons |
| **Discord**     | ✅ Bot Gateway                                                      |
| **Signal**      | ✅ signal-cli integration                                           |
| **WhatsApp**    | ✅ WhatsApp Bridge                                                  |
| **Slack**       | ✅ Socket Mode                                                      |
| **iMessage**    | ✅ BlueBubbles                                                      |
| **Google Chat** | ✅ Service Account                                                  |
| **MS Teams**    | ✅ Bot Framework                                                    |

Additional channel schemas exist in the config layer (IRC, Matrix, LINE, Feishu, Mattermost, Nostr, Twitch) — these are inherited from OpenClaw and may require community extensions.
