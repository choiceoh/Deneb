# Release & Advisory Workflows

- Use `$deneb-release-maintainer` at `.agents/skills/deneb-release-maintainer/SKILL.md` for release naming, version coordination, release auth, and changelog-backed release-note workflows.
- Use `$deneb-ghsa-maintainer` at `.agents/skills/deneb-ghsa-maintainer/SKILL.md` for GHSA advisory inspection, patch/publish flow, private-fork checks, and GHSA API validation.
- Release and publish remain explicit-approval actions even when using the skill.

# Production Deployment

## DGX Spark Production Build

- `make gateway-prod` — Full production binary (output: `dist/deneb-gateway`).

## DGX Spark Operations

- Restart gateway: `pkill -9 -f deneb-gateway || true; nohup ./gateway-go/deneb-gateway --bind loopback --port 18789 > /tmp/deneb-gateway.log 2>&1 &`
- Verify: `ss -ltnp | rg 18789`, `tail -n 120 /tmp/deneb-gateway.log`.
